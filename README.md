## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Lilli. 
I'm preparing to embark on my third career as a business-focused developer. In my past 'lives', as I call them, I was in performing arts before moving into secondary education.  
So, why another move? Well, even more than teaching, I love being a student. I'm presently studying business & technology because I want to harness my creativity in a new way, to build something cool and valuable.
I'm always open to connecting, learning and collaborating.
